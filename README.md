# stroop-effect-analysis
Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

Following questions are answered in this project:

What is the independent variable?
What is the dependent variable?
What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task?
What kind of statistical test shall be performed?
